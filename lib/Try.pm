=head1 SYNOPSIS

    try {
        die "foo";
    }
    catch {
        when (/foo/) {
            warn "Caught foo";
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a try/catch/finally statement. It is based heavily on
(and mostly implemented via) L<Try::Tiny>. The differences are:

=over 4

=item *

It is a statement. C<< my $foo = try { ... } >> doesn't work anymore, but in
return, you don't have to remember the trailing semicolon anymore. C<eval>
still works fine if you need an expression (in 5.14+ at least).

=item *

The blocks are ordered, and only one catch and finally block are supported.
C<< try { } finally { } catch { } >> and
C<< try { } catch { } finally { } finally { } >> do not work with this module,
mostly because that's just extra complexity for no real purpose.

=item *

C<catch> and C<finally> are no longer exported - they are just part of the
syntax of the C<try> statement. This is almost certainly not an issue.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 try

C<try> takes a block to run, and catch exceptions from. The block can
optionally be followed by C<catch> and another block and C<finally> and another
block. The C<catch> block is run when the C<try> block throws an exception, and
the exception thrown will be in both C<$_> and C<@_>. The C<finally> block will
be run after the C<try> and C<catch> blocks regardless of what happens, even if
the C<catch> block rethrows the exception. The exception thrown will be in
C<@_> but B<not> C<$_> (this may change in the future, since I'm pretty sure
the reasoning for this is no longer useful in 5.14).
